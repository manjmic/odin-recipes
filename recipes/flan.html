    <h2>What is flan?</h2>
        <p>Flan is a European and Latin dessert made up of a
         caramel topping and custard base that's made with milk,
          eggs and sweetener (which may already be included in the milk).</p> 
        <p> It is usually baked in a water bath for the best texture,
           and after baking it is chilled then later inverted onto a platter.</p>

    <h4>Crafting Your Flan</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Start by making the caramel. 
                Put the sugar into a saucepan 
                and heat over medium-low, stirring frequently,
                 until it turns into a golden brown syrup. 
                 In the meantime, place your ramekins on a baking tray
                  and surround them with hot water.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour the caramel into the ramekins. Then make the custard. 
                Start by cracking the eggs into a large mixing bowl. 
                Add the sugar and beat until creamy.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the milk and vanilla and beat until well combined. 
                Then pour into the ramekins.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover with foil and put in the oven. 
                Bake for about 40 minutes (until just set â€” the size of your mold will affect the time). 
                Then remove them from the water and let them come to room temperature. 
                Finally, put them in the fridge overnight (or for at least 6 hours).</p></li>
            <li><p>Finally, it's time to gorge on your precious gelatinous flan! Remove the foil and run a butter knife around the edge of the mold. 
                Flip carefully onto a serving plate and enjoy thoroughly!</p></li>
        </ol>
