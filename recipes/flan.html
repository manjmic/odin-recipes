    <h2>What is flan?</h2>
        <p>Flan is a European and Latin dessert made up of a
         caramel topping and custard base that's made with milk,
          eggs and sweetener (which may already be included in the milk).</p> 
        <p> It is usually baked in a water bath for the best texture,
           and after baking it is chilled then later inverted onto a platter.</p>
