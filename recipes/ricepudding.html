    <h2>What is Rice Pudding?</h2>
        <p>Rice pudding is a dish made from rice mixed with water or milk and other ingredients such as cinnamon, vanilla and raisins.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of short grain rice</li>
            <li>1-2 wide slices of lemon rind</li>
            <li>1 stick of cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 ¼ cups of whole milk</li>
            <li>Sugar to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Making Your Pudding</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Rinse the rice under cold water and then put it in a saucepan over a medium heat, just barely covered with water (you could also cover it with milk for even creamier pudding).</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the cinnamon stick and lemon rind. Stir continually until all of the water is absorbed.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add milk about ½ cup at a time, stirring each time until all is absorbed. Continue adding up to the whole liter of milk, stirring continuously.</p></li>
            <li><p>When is seems creamy enough, taste to make sure the texture of the rice is correct. Some prefer it al dente and others like it very cooked (almost mushy).</p></li>
            <li><p>When it is to your liking, turn off the heat and add a pinch of salt and dash of cinnamon. Then, add the sugar a few tablespoons at a time until it is sweet enough for you. Enjoy warm or let cool.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sprinkle a bit more cinnamon on top to decorate!</p></li>
        </ol>
